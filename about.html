            <p>i am strongly concerned with technology and its impact on society, particularly our cultural institutions. i have spent a lot of time thinking deeply about the many ways in which the world is bad. i would prefer to have had spent this time surfing.</p>
            <!-- <p>cryptography is not well-equipped to salvage this state of affairs as-is. many people (including cryptographers) have no interest in using cryptography. however it has proved a handy tool to combat authoritarianism in the past. these days academics use cryptography to track fugitives and improve drm. bleak times.</p>
            <p>it seems like we did manage to survive the ice age, the fall of rome, and world war ii, so i am not particularly concerned with survival so much as not being forced to upload my brain onto a microchip (very abhorrent that there are people who want to do this).</p> 
            <p>the joke is that our brains have already been uploaded onto microchips.</p>
            <p>my prognosis is that as long as we do more of the following we should be okay:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>surfing</li>
                <li>sports in general</li>
                <li>driving on highways, preferably in american cars</li>
                <li>sailing the seas</li>
                <li>paul verhoeven movies</li>
                <li>powerlifting gyms</li>
                <li>posse cuts</li>
                <li>whatever they were doing in montmartre in the 20s</li>
                <li>doner</li>
            </ol> -->
            <p>i have interests in many artistic pursuits, particularly literature and cinema. i write about cinema <a class ="mainlink" href="https://boxd.it/1JruH">here</a>.</p>
            <p>i play the guitar and the piano and support manchester united and the detroit lions. you will often find me saying things like "madeira, manchester, madrid, turin, and manchester again" or "mamba mentality" or "if i speak i am in big trouble". despite this i am a big shill for notorious liverpool supporters lebron james and lana del rey, and for the notorious manchester city (ew) supporters noel and liam gallagher. one of the saddest moments in life is when you discover that your favorite musicians support the wrong football teams.</p>
            <p>i write short stories and don't publish them. i speak two languages and am being forced to pick up a third. i am bad at chess but will never accept it. i should probably start doing stand-up.</p>

            <p>i am a big fan of phil rogaway's dozen suggestions, presented in his ecs127 class. they are tailored towards cryptographers, although they should be applicable to anyone who is doomed to live and die in the 21st century. here they are, reproduced in full.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>speak your mind.</li>
                <li>it's not okay just because it's routine.</li>
                <li>don't buy into the whole "technology will solve it" narrative.</li>
                <li>don't be so damn optimistic.</li>
                <li>don't lie -- to yourself or to others -- about where we are at.</li>
                <li>don't be taken in by all the cs doublespeak.</li>
                <li>in choosing a job, focus on your prospective employer's societal role.</li>
                <li>don't respect authority that doesn't deserve that respect.</li>
                <li>don't buy an expensive home.</li>
                <li>travel.</li>
                <li>don't forget your body.</li>
                <li>no need to be entirely happy and well-adjusted.</li>

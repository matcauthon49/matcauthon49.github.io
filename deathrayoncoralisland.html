            <p><b>TL;DR — I have managed to track down a copy of this film, translated it and published full English subtitles for free online.</b></p>
            <p>珊瑚岛上的死光 (pinyin: shanhu dao shang de shi guang) — known in English as “Death Ray on Coral Island” (dir. Hongmei Zhang, 1980) was the first science fiction film made in post-1949 China, as part of a brief golden age of Chinese science fiction under the early years of Deng Xiaoping. It was adapted from a short story of the same name authored by Tong Enzheng, the first-ever science fiction story published in China’s official literary magazine “Renmin wenxue”.</p>
            <p>As far as I am aware, the only ever English translation of the film was as part of MoMA's <a class="mainlink" href="https://www.moma.org/calendar/film/3855">Future Imperfect: The Uncanny in Science Fiction</a> series presented in the summer of 2017, where it was screened with subtitles. MoMA speculates that this was an unofficial North American theatrical release of the film.</p>
            <p>Anyway, I have managed to procure this film, and published a full translation with subtitles. As far as I am aware, these are the first publicly available English subtitles for the film.</p>
            <p>Here's where you can watch the film online, with English subs, along with some other links:</p>

            <p>combinatorics problems you should (probably not) try.</p>
            
            <h3>> <u>zarankiewicz's problem</u></h3>
            <p><b>the problem:</b> <i>what is the maximum number of edges of a bipartite graph that does not contain \(K_{t,t}\)?</i></p>
            <p>notice that this is easy to rephrase as a problem on matrices (the context in which it was originally posed). represent any graph by its adjacency matrix - a matrix of size \(n^2\), where the \(ij\) entry is \(1\) iff \(i\) and \(j\) share an edge. if this graph is a complete bipartite graph then the adjacency matrix contains a rectangle  (or submatrix) entirely of \(1\)s.</p>
            <p>in general, any graph that contains \(K_{t,t}\) has a \(t\)-sized rectangle formed of \(1\)s. a general closed form for the size of the maximum possible graph is not known. some bounds were shown by erdos. it is suspected that x is the case.</p>

            <h3>> <u>union-closed sets conjecture</u></h3>
            <p><b>the problem:</b> <i>consider a family \(\mathcal{F}\) of subsets of a set \(X\) such that \(A,B\in\mathcal{F}\) implies \(A\cup B\in\mathcal{F}\). then is there an element \(x\in X\) such that \(d(x)\geq \|\mathcal{F}\|/2\)?</i></p>
